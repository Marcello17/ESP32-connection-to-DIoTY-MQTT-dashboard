# ESP32-connection-to-DIoTY-MQTT-dashboard
C++ code in Arduino, which essentially connects the ESP32 to the local WiFi and connect to the DIoTY MQTT server. The code can publish and subscribe a topic.

Note:
I used a MQTT dashboard from the app store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thn.iotmqttdashboard&hl=en_ZA
The MQTT details (port number, username, password and ID) is from the DIoTY: http://www.dioty.co/
the client ID is koikoikoi, but you can use a different one.
